# County Power Level Predictor
## Introduction

Country power prediction using machine learning is a complex task that involves analyzing a wide range of factors, including economic, political, social, and 
environmental variables. With the help of machine learning algorithms, it is possible to identify patterns and trends that can be used to make predictions about 
a country's future power and influence.

The repository would include machine learning models that have been trained on historical data to predict a country's future power, as well as data sets that can be 
used to train and test these models.

The models included in the repository might use a range of machine learning techniques, such as decision trees, random forests, neural networks, and support vector 
machines.

The data sets included in the repository would be diverse and comprehensive, covering a range of economic, political, social, and environmental factors that are known 
to impact a country's power and influence. These data sets might include information on a country's GDP, military strength, population, literacy rate, education level, 
health indicators, environmental factors, and more.

Overall, a GitHub repository focused on country power prediction using machine learning would be a valuable resource for researchers and data scientists interested in 
this important topic. By providing access to models, data sets, and tools for analysis, the repository would enable researchers to explore new approaches to 
understanding and predicting the future of global power dynamics.

## About the dataset
The dataset contains information on various factors that are known to impact a country's power and influence. The data is organized by country and year, and includes 
information on the country's status, power level, civilian deaths, military accidents, substance abuse, military investment, air force, army, intelligence, navy, 
submarines, educational investment, literacy, revolts, GDP, population, offense, defense, political stability, and international reputation.
